\section{Conclusion}
%\vspace*{\subsecspace}

The main insight in this paper is the isomorphism between function keep-alive and object caching.
Using it, sophisticated caching policies can be applied to FaaS.
Our Greedy-Dual based keep-alive policy can reduce cold-start overheads by up to $4\times$ compared to simple policies.
The caching analogy can also be used to enhance resource provisioning.
