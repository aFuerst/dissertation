Functions as a Service (also called serverless computing) promises to revolutionize how applications use cloud resources. 
%
However, it suffers from cold-start problems due to the overhead of initializing code and data dependencies before a function can start executing. 
%
Keeping the functions alive and warm after they have finished execution can alleviate the cold-start overhead. 
%
Keep-alive policies must keep functions alive based on their resource and usage characteristics, which is challenging due to the diversity in FaaS workloads. 
%
Our insight is that keep-alive is analogous to caching.
%
Our caching-inspired Greedy-Dual keep-alive policy can be effective in reducing the cold-start overhead by more than $4\times$ compared to simple keep-alive policies used today. 
%
We hope that our caching analogy opens the door to more principled and optimized keep-alive and resource provisioning policies for future FaaS workloads and platforms.
