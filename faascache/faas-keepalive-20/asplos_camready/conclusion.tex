\section{Conclusion}
%\vspace*{\subsecspace}

The main insight in this paper is the equivalence between function keep-alive and object caching.
This can have far reaching consequences for cloud resource management policies.
We showed that classic size and frequency-aware caching algorithms such as Greedy-Dual can be adapted to yield effective and principled keep-alive policies.
The tradeoff between server memory-utilization and cold start overheads can also be analyzed through hit-ratio curves, which can also be used for dynamic resource allocation.
FaasCache, our OpenWhisk-based system, implements these caching-based techniques.
% something about the evaluation and some results? 
We hope that our caching analogy opens the door to more caching-based serverless systems and analysis. 

%Size and frequency aware caching policies, such as Greedy-Dual, can be used as effective keep-alive policies that balance memory utilization and cold start overheads. The caching approach also facilitates dynamic provisioning using hit-ratio curves.
