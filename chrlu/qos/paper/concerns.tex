Functions are not uniformly affected by load. Some are not affected at all, or have a much higher load threshold.

- Cold/warm can be a heuristic.
- Short/long running ? Combine both the ratio and the time? Use/learn workload small/large function split and use as the parameter? 



** CHBL: Uniform object sizes. Our object size is execution time which may not be known in advance.

** RL
Reward: Tactual/Twarm. Delayed? Or immediate? Assume immediate for now yolo.

** Offline optimal
Pairwise regret?
Dynamic programming?
