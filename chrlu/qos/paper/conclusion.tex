We described and evaluated $k$-CH-RLU, a novel priority- and locality-aware load balancing algorithm for Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) clusters.
$k$-CH-RLU supports $k$ priority levels, dynamically assigns more resources to higher priority functions, and mitigates workload bursts.
Empirical evaluation shows significant performance improvements (by up to $5\times$) compared to OpenWhisk.
Moreover, $k$-CH-RLU can be used to reduce the resources required by the provider: We can reduce the cluster size by $25\%$, while achieving a $3\times$ latency reduction for high-priority functions.
