% We're the best, please accept our paper.
In this paper we have explored the tradeoff between locality and load for serverless functions. 
Our CH-RLU policy can tackle the challenges of function heterogeneity, workload skew, bursty workloads, and stale loads.
We enhance consistent hashing to yield a simple and practical load-balancing policy. 
Empirical evaluation shows substantial improvements in function latency (by more than $2\times$) compared to current OpenWhisk.
