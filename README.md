The thesis proposal is submitted and defended after the completion of the Qualifying Examination,
after Nomination to Candidacy, and after the Nomination of Research Committee.

It consists of a written research plan for the Dissertation, followed by an oral presentation to the Research Committee.

Students should consult with their Research Committee Chair about the exact form of the proposal document and presentation.

Typically, the thesis proposal is a detailed document that describes the student’s proposed dissertation research, including introducing the topic, motivating why it is
important, describing existing work and how the research would be different, summarizing the student’s research progress so far, and describing the plan for the remainder of the dissertation research.

Typically, the oral exam is a 45-minute presentation to the Research Committee that summarizes the proposal document, followed by questioning and discussion with the Committee.

Upon finishing the Thesis Proposal, the completed Dissertation Proposal form, with “pass” or “fail” clearly marked must be submitted by the student to the Luddy Graduate Studies Office. 

If failed, the Thesis Proposal may be attempted again with the consent of the Research Committee.

To prepare and defend your Thesis Proposal:
* Discuss the format and expectations of the proposal document and oral exam with your Research Committee Chair.
* Prepare the Thesis Proposal written document.
* Submit your written document to the Research Committee, and arrange a time with them for the oral exam. 
  Typically, committees will require your written document to be submitted several weeks before the oral exam.
* Immediately after the oral exam, complete the Dissertation Proposal form, and then submit it to the Luddy Graduate Studies Office
