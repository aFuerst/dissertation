abstract = {While parallelism remains the main source of performance, architectural implementations and programming models change with each new hardware generation, often leading to costly application re-engineering. Most tools for performance portability require manual and costly application porting to yet another programming model.We propose an alternative approach that automatically translates programs written in one programming model (CUDA), into another (CPU threads) based on Polygeist/MLIR. Our approach includes a representation of parallel constructs that allows conventional compiler transformations to apply transparently and without modification and enables parallelism-specific optimizations. We evaluate our framework by transpiling and optimizing the CUDA Rodinia benchmark suite for a multi-core CPU and achieve a 58\% geomean speedup over handwritten OpenMP code. Further, we show how CUDA kernels from PyTorch can efficiently run and scale on the CPU-only Supercomputer Fugaku without user intervention. Our PyTorch compatibility layer making use of transpiled CUDA PyTorch kernels outperforms the PyTorch CPU native backend by 2.7\texttimes{}.},

abstract = {The emerging serverless computing paradigm has attracted attention from both academia and industry. This paradigm brings benefits such as less operational complexity, a pay-as-you-go pricing model, and an auto-scaling feature. The paradigm opens up new opportunities and challenges for cloud application developers. In this article, we present a comprehensive overview of the past development as well as the recent advances in research areas related to serverless computing. First, we survey serverless applications introduced in the literature. We categorize applications in eight domains and separately discuss the objectives and the viability of the serverless paradigm along with challenges in each of those domains. We then classify those challenges into nine topics and survey the proposed solutions. Finally, we present the areas that need further attention from the research community and identify open problems.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) serverless computing enables a simple programming model with almost unbounded elasticity. Unfortunately, current FaaS platforms achieve this flexibility at the cost of lower performance for data-intensive applications compared to a serverful deployment. The ability to have computation close to data is a key missing feature. We introduce Palette load balancing, which offers FaaS applications a simple mechanism to express locality to the platform, through hints we term “colors”. Palette maintains the serverless nature of the service – users are still not allocating resources – while allowing the platform to place successive invocations related to each other on the same executing node. We compare a prototype of the Palette load balancer to a state-of-the-art locality-oblivious load balancer on representative examples of three applications. For a serverless web application with a local cache, Palette improves the hit ratio by 6x. For a serverless version of Dask, Palette improves run times by 46% and 40% on Task Bench and TPC-H, respectively. On a serverless version of NumS, Palette improves run times by 37%. These improvements largely bridge the gap to serverful implementation of the same systems},

  abstract  = {Functions as a Service (also called serverless computing) promises to revolutionize
               how applications use cloud resources. However, functions suffer from cold-start problems
               due to the overhead of initializing their code and data dependencies before they can
               start executing. Keeping functions alive and warm after they have finished execution
               can alleviate the cold-start overhead. Keep-alive policies must keep functions alive
               based on their resource and usage characteristics, which is challenging due to the
               diversity in FaaS workloads. Our insight is that keep-alive is analogous to caching.
               Our caching-inspired Greedy-Dual keep-alive policy can be effective in reducing the
               cold-start overhead by more than 3\texttimes{} compared to current approaches. Caching concepts
               such as reuse distances and hit-ratio curves can also be used for auto-scaled server
               resource provisioning, which can reduce the resource requirement of FaaS providers
               by 30% for real-world dynamic workloads. We implement caching-based keep-alive and
               resource provisioning policies in our FaasCache system, which is based on OpenWhisk.
               We hope that our caching analogy opens the door to more principled and optimized keep-alive
               and resource provisioning techniques for future FaaS workloads and platforms.},
